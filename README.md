# 74HC595-Microcontroller-Output-Expansion

This project explores how to use the **74HC595 shift register** to expand the number of digital outputs available on an **ESP8266**, using just 3 GPIO pins. It’s built with **PlatformIO**, but you can also upload the same code using the **Arduino IDE**. The example includes code to control all 8 outputs by sending serial data to the shift register.


## Why I Built This?

I recently heard about the 74HC595 shift register and was curious how it could help expand the I/O capabilities of microcontrollers like the ESP8266. Since I had one of these chips lying around, I decided to try it out and learn how to communicate with it directly.

This experiment is part of my ongoing exploration into embedded systems, and it gave me a solid understanding of how to use **serial-to-parallel communication** to control more devices with fewer pins.

This repo documents my process, includes sample code, and provides diagrams and reference material for others who want to try the same.


## What You'll Learn

- What the 74HC595 does and how it works  
- How to use `shiftOut()` to control outputs  
- How to connect the shift register to an ESP8266  
- What the latch pin does and how the internal shift register works

### 🧩 This Project is Part of a Shift Register I/O Expansion Series

This repository is the **first part** of a series exploring how to expand the I/O capabilities of microcontrollers using shift registers:

- **Part 1**:  [74HC595-Microcontroller-Output-Expansion (this repo)](https://github.com/Yamil-Serrano/74HC595-Microcontroller-Output-Expansion)  
- **Part 2**:  [74HC165-Microcontroller-Input-Expansion](https://github.com/Yamil-Serrano/74HC165-Microcontroller-Input-Expansion)

 In Part 2, I cover how to read multiple digital inputs (like buttons or switches) using the **74HC165** shift register.  
It’s the *reverse* of this project — instead of sending data **to** outputs (serial-to-parallel), we’ll read data **from** inputs using **parallel-to-serial** communication.

## Technical Deep Dive: How Those 3 Lines Actually Work

When you write:

```cpp
digitalWrite(latchPin, LOW);
shiftOut(dataPin, clockPin, MSBFIRST, byteValue);
digitalWrite(latchPin, HIGH);
```

You are directly controlling the **flow of bits** into the shift register and when they are revealed on the output pins (Q0–Q7). Here's a breakdown:

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **`digitalWrite(latchPin, LOW);`**  
   This disables the latch. You're telling the 74HC595 to *prepare* for incoming data, but **not to change the output pins just yet**. Think of this like opening the gate to a loading dock.

2. **`shiftOut(dataPin, clockPin, MSBFIRST, byteValue);`**  
   This is where the magic happens. Our microcontroller sends the `byteValue` **one bit at a time**, starting with the **most significant bit** (MSB) if you specify `MSBFIRST`.

   For each bit:
   - The bit value is written to the `dataPin`.
   - A clock pulse is sent via `clockPin` (`SHCP` on the chip), telling the shift register to **capture** the current bit and **shift** all previously stored bits one position to the right.
   - Internally, each clock pulse triggers the flip-flops to transfer data down the line — like a **domino effect**, each flip-flop passes its content to the next.

3. **`digitalWrite(latchPin, HIGH);`**  
   Once all 8 bits are in place, this command **copies** the current contents of the **shift register** into the **storage register**, which drives the output pins Q0–Q7.


## How It Works (Shift Register Logic)

The 74HC595 contains two key internal components:

- A **Shift Register (SR)**: where bits are shifted in serially via the `DS` (data) and `SHCP` (clock) pins.
- A **Storage Register (Latch)**: where the bits are copied to when you toggle the `STCP` (latch) pin high.

Here’s what happens in sequence:

1. You call `shiftOut(dataPin, clockPin, MSBFIRST, byteValue);`  
   → This pushes 8 bits (a full byte) into the **shift register**, bit by bit.

2. While the latch pin (`STCP`) is LOW, the output pins (Q0–Q7) don’t change yet.  
   → Think of it like writing to a **buffer**.

3. Once you set the latch pin HIGH, all 8 bits are **copied** from the shift register to the **output storage register**.  
   → This updates all Q0–Q7 simultaneously.

4. You can repeat this process anytime to send new data.

 So the shift register acts like an **internal stack**, constantly being overwritten every time you call `shiftOut()`. The latch ensures outputs only update *when you say so*.

###  What’s Inside: Flip-Flops and Data Shifting

At the hardware level, the shift register is made of **8 serially connected D-type flip-flops**:

```
DS → [FF1] → [FF2] → [FF3] → ... → [FF8]
        ↑     ↑     ↑           ↑
       Q7    Q6    Q5   ...     Q0
```

- Each **D flip-flop** stores a single bit.
- On every **clock pulse**, the current state of each flip-flop is **pushed** to the next one.
- The **new bit** (from `dataPin`) enters the first flip-flop (Q7).
- The previously stored bits shift **rightward**, like a conveyor belt.

Once 8 clock cycles are done, the shift register holds the full byte, but **none of the outputs change yet**.

That’s where the **storage register** comes in:
- When the `latchPin` (STCP) is set HIGH, the contents of the shift register are **latched** into the storage register and reflected on the output pins **all at once**.
- This separation prevents the outputs from flickering during the shifting process.

## Code Overview

The example cycles through all 256 possible byte values (0–255), showing every output state combination. Each value lights up a unique combination of output pins. The latch ensures smooth transition between states.

See `src/main.cpp` for the full code.



## Is This a Decoder or Multiplexer?

At first glance, the **74HC595** might look like a decoder or a multiplexer because it has 3 input pins and 8 output lines. But it's actually a different kind of digital IC.

The **74HC595 is a shift register**, not a decoder or mux.

Here’s a quick comparison to avoid confusion:

### Decoder vs Shift Register

| Feature                     | Decoder (e.g. 74HC138)                     | Shift Register (74HC595)                     |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Inputs                     | 3 (binary selector)                        | 3 (Data, Clock, Latch)                       |
| Outputs                    | 8 (Q0 to Q7)                               | 8 (Q0 to Q7)                                 |
| Active Outputs             | Only **one at a time**                     | **Any combination** of outputs               |
| How It Works               | Selects one output line based on binary input | Loads 8 bits serially and pushes to outputs |
| Memory?                    | ❌ No memory                               | ✅ Has internal shift + latch registers      |
| Use Case                   | Device/address selection                   | Controlling multiple outputs (LEDs, etc.)    |

### ✅ 74HC595 Use Case:
With the **74HC595**, you can control any combination of the 8 output pins just by sending 8 bits of data using `shiftOut()` from your microcontroller. The `latch` pin ensures that outputs only update once you're ready, making it very stable for visual displays or multi-output devices.

### ❌ Decoder Use Case:
A decoder like the **74HC138** activates **only one output at a time** based on a binary input (e.g. input `010` activates **Q2** only). This is great for **addressing** or **selecting** one of many devices, but not for driving many outputs simultaneously.
